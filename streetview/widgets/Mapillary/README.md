**Mapillary is a street-level imagery platform powered by computer vision.**

Mapillaryâ€™s mission is to understand the world's places through images and make this understanding available to all. Mapillary provides apps and tools for everyone, enabling individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide to contribute with street-level imagery. All images are connected in 3D and objects recognized in images are automatically labeled and turned into geospatial data. Mapillary has a viewer, APIs, and developer tools for easy use of this imagery and geospatial data in a wide range of applications. Today, more than 100 million images have been contributed to Mapillary and are being used to better understand the world, helping cities and citizens develop infrastructure, map makers to build maps, and automotive companies to create safer transportation.
